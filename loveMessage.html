    <p class="message">
      From the moment I met you, my world changed forever. You‚Äôve filled my life with so much happiness and love that words can't fully express how much you mean to me. Every moment spent with you is a blessing, and I want you to know that my love for you will never fade, no matter where life takes us. You are my heart, my soulmate, and the love of my life. üíñ.
      You are the greatest blessing I have had in my life and I will ever have as well.
       It's been two years now and I wish I was there right beside you to celebrate this moment together and I pray we do this for our next anniversary. But it'll always remain true how much I love you and I always will.
       Everything about you is the best I could've ever wished for. Every time I watch a couple reel or listen to a romantic song, it reminds me of you and the dreams we wish to come true for our journey.
       So please always stay by side my love. You are and will be the only one for me. Thank you for everything.
       I Love You So Much Wifey
